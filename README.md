# nwg-icon-picker

This program is a part of the [nwg-shell](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell) project.

I was looking for a GTK icon browser with a good textual search feature. Turns out it's easier to write one in less than 150 sloc.

This program is intended to work as the icon picker for [nwg-panel](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel), but it may be used standalone.
It displays a window to choose an icon with a textual search entry, and returns the icon name.
